📌 Notes Dates must be in the format yyyy-MM-dd and should be in the future.
Phone numbers must be 10 digits.

Events are stored in a Binary Search Tree and displayed in sorted order using Inorder traversal.

Bookings are handled using a queue to ensure FIFO order.

Expenses are managed with categories (via Enum) and compared with the set budget.
